-> Callback (callback hell)
  function(){
      function(){
          function(){
              function(){

              }
          }
      }
  }

-> Promises :- To handle a asynchronous operations.It is an assurance that something will be done.
--> Async / Await :- It is used to work promises in asynchronous functions.It is just a wrapper to restyle code and make promises eaiser to read and use. It makes asynchronous code look more like synchronous , which is easier to understand.
    -> async functions : if we placed a async keyword before any function , that function return a promise
      async function abc(){
                return 123;
            }
           abc().then(res=>{
               console.log(res)
           })
    -> await :-  await keyword makes javascript wait until that promise settles and return its result.We can use await only with async function.

    eg:
       async function xyz(){
          let promise=new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{
              setTimeout(()=>{
                 resolve("Sumit Joshi")
              },2000)
          })
          let result= await promise;//wait until the promise resolve;
          console.log(result);
       } 
       xyz();
       (async ()=>{

       })();
